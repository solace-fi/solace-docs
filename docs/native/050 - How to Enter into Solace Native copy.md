### **The Underwriter Experience Example**

---

1. DApp XYZ wants Native insurance. They reach out to the Solace team via the Native website, the Solace Discord, Twitter, etc.
2. The Solace Risk Management team assesses the risk profile of the XYZ contracts, approves the protocol for a new Insurance Gauge, and whitelists the $XYZ token. 
3. XYZ team opens an underwriter lock by depositing $1 million worth of $XYZ into the underwriting pool. In return, XYZ team receives $UWE tokens that are forwarded to their lock.
4. The underwriting lock has a minimum lock of 6 months with a 1x multiplier.
5. **CHOICE**: XYZ can keep the lock time the same, or increase their lock up to 4 years, which can get them up to 2.8x voting power. Voting power follows a quadratic function.
6. The XYZ team uses their voting shares and votes for their XYZ Insurance Gauge.
7. XYZ is granted their share of the insurance capacity based on their Insurance Gauge’s total votes.
8. Underwriter locks are charged the premium fee based on the insurance gauge(s) they’ve allocated votes to.
