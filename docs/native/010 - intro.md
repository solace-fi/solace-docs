## Why Solace Native Was Created

DeFi continues to experience its growing pains via catastrophic hacks and exploits, a clear indicator of the need for scalable insurance. Current solutions are slim and require wallets to buy insurance for individual positions with rigid terms and conditions. 

It is simply not enough. We need a solution that pools the risk of all DeFi users from the unjustifiable risks within our ecosystem - we need the fail-safe mechanism to back DeFi. 

So Solace decided to **build DeFi’s base layer of insurance** that everyone can count on, regardless of their level of participation of DeFi.

## Why Solace Native Was Created

Solace Native insures DApps against smart contract risk. Native uses a governance mechanism where DApps, DAOs, and protocols vote to distribute Solace’s insurance capacity. Like the FDIC, Solace Native provides the recommended coverage value to protect the DApp and its individual users against various on-chain economic and technical exploits. 

## The Advantages of Native

1. DApp-level insurance that protects against smart contract risk
2. Access insurance and pay premiums utilizing your protocol’s native token
3. Longer commitments yield more coverage for less
4. A crypto-native FDIC

Solace recommends at least a $1,000 coverage value per user, and can build a custom quote for your DApp if **[requested](linl). However, the coverage limit is ultimately chosen by the DApp team.
