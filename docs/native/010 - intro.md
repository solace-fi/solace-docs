## Why Solace Native Was Created

DeFi continues to experience its growing pains via catastrophic smart contract exploits, a clear indicator that a security approach solely focused on audits is not enough to secure DeFi DApps. More than ever before, there is a serious need for scalable insurance that can insure DApps at scale.

Solace built DeFi’s first and only base layer of insurance to protect the ecosystem at scale, garner high user trust, and ultimately, improve the security measures across DApps in DeFi.

## What is Solace Native?

Solace Native insures DApps against smart contract risk. Native uses a governance mechanism where DApps, DAOs, and protocols vote to distribute Solace’s insurance capacity. Like the FDIC, Solace Native provides the recommended coverage value to protect the DApp and its individual users against various on-chain economic and technical exploits. Just like the FDIC.

## The Advantages of Native

1. DApp-level insurance that protects against smart contract risk
2. Access insurance and pay premiums utilizing your protocol’s native token
3. Longer commitments yield more coverage for less
4. A crypto-native FDIC with prevention and protection offerings to improve DApp security

Solace recommends at least a $1,000 coverage value per user, and can build a custom quote for your DApp if requested. However, the coverage limit is ultimately chosen by the DApp team.
