title: Prevention and Protection Offerings
---

Solace Native is more than just insurance. Native offers a suite of preventative measures to improve a DApps’ security. DApps that take advantage of our suite of protection methods can directly lower their premium rate. These include: 
1. Audits
2. Bug bounty sponsorships 
3. Smart contract monitoring, thanks to the  network
4. Best practices

Moreover, Solace will subsidize financial and technical support to promote secure practices and quality code.
## Audits
Solace’s risk assessment process looks directly at whether a DApp has undergone audits. Those that do, improve their risk score, and in turn, lower their premium.

DApps that want support and to improve their audit score can work with our partner audit and code review groups, who will take a deep dive into the smart contracts and address critical vulnerabilities.

Starting in Fall 2022, Solace will launch its own audit pipeline for Native DApps, allowing you to schedule regular audits without stretching the budget.

## Bug Bounty Programs
Solace includes bug bounty programs in their risk assessment process based on whether a DApp has a bug bounty program and how large the bounty pool is. By deploying a bug bounty program, DApps can improve their risk score, and in turn, lower their premium.

Solace will sponsor the bounties, match critical vulnerability bounties, and communicate it across our network of white hats, so as many eyes can review a DApp’s code base for bugs.

**Solace has also partnered with [Hats Finance](https://hats.finance/)** to help DApps deploy a decentralized bug bounty.

## Smart contract monitoring  

Smart contract monitoring is a great way to improve the responsiveness of a system in moments of stress or crisis. 

**Solace partners with [Forta](https://forta.org/)**, a smart contract agent developer community that creates agents that monitor smart contract activity and watches smart contracts for transaction invariances. When an agent detects an invariance, the core team is immediately notified and they can take the proper steps to either pause the targeted smart contract or block the attacker from their user.

We highly encourage teams to implement smart contract monitoring. Solace has done this for our own on-chain infrastructure and will guide you through the process, bringing the best practices and getting the best community agent developers, so you won’t have to allocate much of your bandwidth to the task.

## Best practices

There are several valuable best practices that exist with smart contract architecture. Things like timelocks, flashloan resistance standards, oracle front running resistance standards, and many other prevention practices ensure DApps can protect all parts of their protocols. 

We highly encourage teams to implement best practices into their smart contracts, testing methods, and documentation. Partners like [DeFiSafety](https://www.defisafety.com/)can assist DApps to achieve strong security score.
