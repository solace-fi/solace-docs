# Solace Launch DAO

The core team, investors, and advisors created the Solace Launch DAO on [<u>Aragon</u>](https://client.aragon.org/#/solacelaunch/), which acts as a coordination vehicle to deliver Solace DAO. For now, the Launch DAO will hold the funds, $SOLACE tokens, and be controlled by $SVOTE tokens.

The philosophy of the operational model is based off the [<u>DAO-first approach</u>](https://blog.synthetix.io/dao-first-capital-formation/) conceived by Kain Warwick of BarnBrigde. The goal is to democratize the control and run the project as a DAO from day 0, have complete transparency on voted proposals, and quickly adjust to the evolving DeFi landscape. We believe in the future of open finance and decentralization, and Solace sees the LaunchDAO as a foundation to seamlessly hand off the governance to the community after the fundamental product and infrastructure are built.

The main purposes of the Launch DAO is:

1. Investments are credited to the Launch DAO account, and only after that, they are sent to core multisig.
2. Key decisions in Solace's early stages are made via DAO voting on [<u>Aragon</u>](https://client.aragon.org/#/solacelaunch/).


## Voting Process

The Solace Launch DAO has its own $SVOTE token, a governance voting token that its members use to submit their vote on-chain. The founding team controls 44% of the $SVOTE token supply, while 16% goes to the advisors, and 40% to the investors. To successfully pass a proposal, at least 51% of the shares must participate, and the vote must have a 67% "Yes" vote count. Each proposal has a vote duration of 48 hours.

## Membership 

The members of the LaunchDAO are as follows:

Gustav Arentoft and Doo Wan Nam (MakerDAO & StableNode), Preston Van Loon (Prysmatic Labs), Sandeep Nailwal and Arjun Kalsy (Polygon), Illia Polosukhin (NEAR), Alex Shevchenko (Aurora), Aleksander Larsen and Jeffrey Zirlin (Axie Infinity), Seth Ginns (CoinFund), Evgeny Yurtaev (Zerion), Kiril Nikolov (Nexo), Julien Bouteloup (StakeDAO & rekt.news), Quentin Milne (Stake Capital), Cameron Dennis (Blockchain Acceleration Foundation), and members from Alchemy, Parataxis Capital, LD Capital, 1010.capital, and Prycto.
