# Timelocks
---
At this point in time, there are no timelocks in Solace. Because the team is building many new products and services during its current early stages, and because the current Launch DAO system is focused on growing the protocol functionality and TVL, this is not yet incorporated into the protocol. It is a consideration for the future once the transition from Launch DAO to DAO is complete.
