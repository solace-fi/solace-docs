# Contract Ownership
---
Contract ownership is right now: Contract Ownership is OnlyOwner at the moment with main smart contract dev as the onlyowner. The onlyowner has the governance role to build and test the smart contract. Once an update is ready, the team runs a script, which deploys the smart contract from the OnlyOwner's wallet.

It is important to note that major changes, particularly those that would affect users and token holders are disclosed to the DAO to have discussions on. The core team ensures that they hear the community before making stark changes to the protocol.
