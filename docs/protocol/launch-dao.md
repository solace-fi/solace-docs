# Solace Launch DAO

The Solace Launch DAO is controlled by the core team, investors and advisors. It has its own $SVOTE token, a governance voting token that its members use to submit their vote on-chain. Investors put their money in the Launch DAO, and every couple of months, the Solace team pulls money from LaunchDAO multisig to the Core multisig. From the Core multisig, Solace runs payroll and expenses.

The main purpose of the Launch DAO is:

1. Investments are credited to the Launch DAO account, and only after that, they are sent to core multisig.
2. Key decisions in Solace's early stages are made via DAO voting on Aragon.
