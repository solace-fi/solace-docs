Our risk management team is building scalable pipelines that can become increasingly decentralized as the community grows. For the Solace Wallet coverage the main task was to aggregate enough data to be able to come up with predictive variables for the likelihood of exploits. The goal is to allow the community to contribute to this data aggregation as well as come up with their own analysis and judgements, ultimately increasing the awareness and data availability in the whole DeFi space. Governance will play a key role here and all submits will be reviewed by the governance members through voting.
