# The $SOLACE Token

### Why is there a $SOLACE token?
In order to decentralize Solace and reward contributors and supporters of the protocol, Solace developed the $SOLACE token with two primary functions. The first is that it acts as a governance token, allotting voting power to holders for future votes once the Solace DAO is released at the end of 2021. The second is that users can stake $SOLACE and earn revenue from underwriting activity from premium fees.

### How is the token price determined?
The price is determined by dividing the $SOLACE reserves by the USDC reserves on SushiSwap.

## Did a Token Generation event take place at launch?
Yes. The original token generation began with a soft launch, with 50 million coins beginning in circulation. $SOLACE total supply is set at 1,000,000,000. Below is the break down of the allocations and target use.

### Solace Launch DAO: 32%

- Core Team: 25% (Growth Fund — 13%, Current Contributors —12%). The purpose of the Growth fund is to employ future contributors and finance the operations in the near term, before the transition to and maturity of community-run Solace DAO to take over this responsibility.
- Seed Round Investors: 5% (currently allocated 3.83%*).
- Advisors: 2% (currently allocated 0.4%*).

*unallocated tokens will remain in the Solace Launch DAO treasury and will be used at the discretion of the DAO in the future.

### Community: 68%

- Solace DAO Treasury: 50%. These funds will be governed directly by the community to finance contributor compensations, grants, operations, and other needs to sustain development of Solace long-term.
- Underwriting Pool: 10%.
- Incentives: 8%. This allocation encompasses all short to mid-term incentives we have put in place and are introducing along with the token launch, like bonding and staking. More information and exact details are coming in the next post.

### How can I obtain $SOLACE?
The first way is to purchase [<u>$SOLACE on Sushiswap</u>](https://app.sushi.com/swap?inputCurrency=0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48&outputCurrency=0x501acE9c35E60f03A2af4d484f49F9B1EFde9f40 ) in the $SOLACE/USDC pool. For now, this is the only pool available. However, more pool options will be available in the future.

The second way is to purchase $SOLACE via bonds. Bonds allow you to use several different tokens to purchase $SOLACE at a discount. The vesting period for tokens purchased via bonds is five days. The steps are:
- Go to [<u>Solace's Website</u>](https://solace.fi/bond), and connect your wallet.
- Decide the token you would like to purchase a bond with and click Bond.
- Input your desired amount of tokens you would like to provide.
- (Optional) If you would like to have your bonded tokens staked, select “Auto-stake and receive xSOLACE”
- Confirm the transaction in your wallet.

Note: if you do not auto-stake with the bond, you will not be able to stake until the 5-day vesting period is complete.

### What is the $xSOLACE token?
$xSOLACE is the staked $SOLACE token. $SOLACE can be staked to get $xSOLACE for the following purposes:
- To earn protocol’s revenue from the underwriting activity and $SOLACE distribution.
- To unlock the governance rights and allocate coverage capacity across risk strategies.

While individual users can stake $SOLACE to earn reward, Protocols and DAOs also have motivation to stake $SOLACE and influence coverage capacity allocation for its product.
