# Risk Assessment

### Does Solace use $SOLACE tokens to vote on claims approvals?
No. $SOLACE is a governance token, but it is not used to vote on approving claims. Instead, Solace uses our PACLAS system and other claims assessment models to determine if a claim can be submitted.

### How does Solace design it’s risk assessment systems?
Solace built an architecture that facilitates and incentivizes intelligent risk assessment in a distributed manner through the parametric auto claims assessment system (PACLAS). However, thanks to Solace’s upcoming coverage marketplace, anyone can develop his/her own risk models, deploy it and release coverage products. 

### How are models outside the PACLAS system funded?
If the model is approved via a governance vote, a portion of the underwriting pools’ funds are locked for the purposes of selling cover for a new model. The capital pool underwrites the risk across a variety of risk assessment models that manage coverage products. Please check the Become Risk Manager guide for more information.
