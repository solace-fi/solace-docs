# Cover Products

### What cover products does Solace offer?
Currently, we support smart contract cover only. More protocol products are in the works by both Solace core team and community risk managers. Please stay updated for new releases through Twitter and Discord.

Each product provides policies for a single protocol, across all of its smart contracts that hold value, so the pricing and capacity is set on a by-protocol basis. Though a new version of a protocol requires a new product (e.g., Uniswap V2 versus Uniswap V3).

### What protocols are covered?
Protocol and platforms currently covered by Solace:

- Aave
- Compound
- Liquity
- Yearn.Finance
- Uniswap V2 & V3
- Sushiswap

### What are the current coverage policies?
Below is a brief list of possible covered events. Please read Terms & Conditions for the full disclosure of what constitutes a covered event and refer to Claims Assessment and Open a Claim to learn more about the claims process and the mechanics behind it.
Solace will provide coverage policies across following exploits types:
- Minting vulnerability
- Flash loan attack
- Trojan fake token
- Proxy manipulation
- Math error
- Re-entry attack

Solace coverage does not provide for:
- Price arbitrage
- Compromised private keys
- Phishing attacks
- Front-end attacks

Solace only pays out financial loss (within coverage limit) and not the overall position covered by the end customer.

### How are coverages given to users?
Once a user purchases a coverage policy, they mint an NFT called SPT. This gives them rights to claiming for a loss event. When submitting a claim, the SPT NFT is burnt and a new NFT called a SCT is minted. Finally, the SCT can be redeemed for ETH.

### How does Solace accumulate funds to cover all policies?
Solace has the Underwriting Pool, which is a pool of funds that holds ETH used to pay out claims. The pool is primarily funded through bonds. Users can buy bonds with their assets in exchange for $SOLACE (https://solace.fi/bond). All bonds vest after 5 days.

### Can claim redemptions ever outweigh the size of the Underwriting Pool?
Currently, no. There is a safety mechanism designed to check how much ETH is available in the protocol’s reserves when you buy cover. If the amount of cover nears the reserve’s capacity, the protocol will not sell policies.

This can potentially change as Solace scales.  As the reserve increases in size, there is a greater availability to oversell policies and leverage the reserve given that the probability of all positions getting exploited is very low.
