# Solace: The Basics

## What is Solace?
Solace is an alternative to DeFi insurance that gives users cover for their investment across DeFi platforms. There always exists risk with any DeFi investment due to smart contract exploitation. Therefore, Solace aims to help its users get protection against the threats of potential loss through cover policies. 


## Why was Solace Built?
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a revolution in finance, and it is one of the fastest growing industries in the world. Currently, [$100 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1237821/defi-market-size-value-crypto-locked-usd/) is locked in DeFi projects and proposals, and [some investors believe the market cap could break $80 trillion](https://cointelegraph.com/news/tim-draper-predicts-total-crypto-market-cap-of-80-trillion-in-next-15-years#:~:text=Sep%2015%2C%202018-,Tim%20Draper%20Predicts%20Total%20Crypto%20Market%20Cap%20of%20%2480%20Trillion,in%20the%20next%2015%20years.) in the next 15 years. However, like any rapidly growing industry, growing pains ensue, and DeFi is not an exception to this rule.

In the last year alone, 76% of major hacks occurred in DeFi protocols, totalling at ~$361 million of theft. As DeFi continues to grow in the next decade, it will be likely that hacks and exploits will increase, especially as new financial product concepts emerge.

DeFi insurance is an absolute necessity to protect DeFi users, and that is Solace’s whole purpose - to protect new and existing DeFi users through its insurance tools.

Solace is building a community around making this space safe, secure, and trusted so that we can onboard and de-risk DeFi and other crypto applications while opening the space to millions of users. We cherish the long-term vision of secure and simple access to DeFi and plan to create the best tools that encapsulate this mission.

## What is the governance structure?
Please read this blog post that outlines the current governance structure in more detail https://link.medium.com/cQ8cWwY16jb

### DAO-first capital formation
Pioneered by BarnBridge and Kain Warwick’s ideas, this crypto native approach offers a unique ability to run the project as a DAO from day 0, have complete transparency, equitable voting, and quickly adjust to an ever-changing environment in DeFi. This setup entails that the project is financed and launched by a decentralized governance model.

### DAO structure
At the moment we have launched Solace LaunchDAO, which acts as a coordination vehicle to deliver us to Solace DAO. This LaunchDAO holds the funds, $SOLACE tokens, is controlled by the Launch DAO tokens and primarily votes on high-level protocol decisions of significant importance. The funds are released in a drip fashion over time to finance the development and growth and ultimately ensure transition into a formal community-run DAO structure.

### Transition to Community-run DAO in the Future
The purpose of this Launch DAO is to bootstrap the development and allow for rapid scaling of Solace’s platform. Eventually we are going to reach the point where the governance can be handed off to the community and Solace can be a self-sustaining protocol. With that in mind, our job is to push the project forward, build a community around it, and create a system that will inherit the rule.

Starting October, we plan to allocate resources to the development of Solace DAO, so you can expect the transition to happen around the end of this year.
