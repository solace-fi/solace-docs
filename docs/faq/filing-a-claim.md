# Filing a Claim

### How do I file a claim?
1. Open the Solace dashboard and find the position you want to submit a claim for.
2. Click the “Claim” button. 
3. If the protocol detects a loss event, you will be able to “Submit Claim”.

Note that payout stays in Escrow for one week as a cooldown period. Solace or anyone else does not have access to funds at that time.

### How do I provide proof of loss?
Fortunately, you will not have to do that. As long as you have the wallet connected to Solace, the protocol will be able to read your wallet activity and detect the loss event.

### How long does the claims process take?
Payouts are locked in escrow for one week as a cooldown period. No one, including Solace, has access to funds at that time. After the cooldown period ends, the payout will be made to your wallet.

### When is loss of funds determined for a claim?
Solace utilizes a parametric auto claims assessment system (PACLAS), which monitors coverage policies, determines financial losses, and signs proof that allows users to submit a claim transaction and receive a pay out.
