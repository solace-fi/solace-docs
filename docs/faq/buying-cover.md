# Buying Cover 

### How do I purchase cover?
1. First, ensure the protocol you’d like to buy coverage for is one of the options Solace provides coverage for.
2. Then, open solace.fi and connect your wallet that has the tokens you want to protect.
3. Click on the “Buy Cover” tab and select the protocol you want to cover.
4. Choose the position within the protocol you want to cover for. Then choose:
    - the amount of your position to protect 
    - the length of coverage
    - <b>Note:</b> both of these items are able to be extended after purchasing the policy
5. Click the “Buy coverage” button and confirm the transaction in your wallet. Now, you’re covered!

### Can I buy cover for assets in wallets other than my own?
Yes, you are able to via calling the smart contract directly through etherscan. There is not yet a UI for the tool, but it is under development.

### Can I buy several cover policies for assets under one wallet and still be covered?
Yes, you can purchase several policies under one wallet and those positions will be covered if your wallet suffers a loss of funds.

### If I buy one cover policy for assets deposited from several wallets, would I still be covered if I lost funds?
You will only be covered for the wallet that has the cover policy. 

### How do you price cover products?
The cover price is a 2.19 - 2.39% fee of the position that is being covered for.

### What loss events are covered?
Solace will provide coverage policies across following exploits types:
- Minting vulnerability
- Flash loan attack
- Trojan fake token
- Proxy manipulation
- Math error
- Re-entry attack

Solace coverage does not provide for:
- Price arbitrage
- Compromised private keys
- Phishing attacks
- Front-end attacks

### What happens if I sell a portion or all of my position and later get back into the same position? Is my cover buy still valid?
Yes, the cover will still be valid if the position changes.
