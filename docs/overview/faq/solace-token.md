# The $SOLACE Token
---

### Why is there a $SOLACE token?
In order to decentralize Solace and reward contributors and supporters of the protocol, Solace developed the $SOLACE token with two primary functions. The first is that it acts as a governance token, allotting voting power to holders for future votes once the Solace DAO is released at the end of 2022. The second is that users can stake $SOLACE and earn revenue from policy sales and token emissions.

### How is the token price determined?
The price is determined by dividing the $SOLACE reserves by the stabletoken reserve within each live chain's liquidity pool.

## Did a Token Generation event take place at launch?
Yes. The original token generation began with a soft launch, with 50 million coins beginning in circulation. $SOLACE total supply is set at 1,000,000,000. You can see more data on token circulation [<u>here</u>](https://stats.solace.fi).

Below is the break down of the allocations and target use.

### Solace Launch DAO: 32%

- Core Team: 25% (Growth Fund — 13%, Current Contributors —12%). The purpose of the Growth fund is to employ future contributors and finance the operations in the near term, before the transition to and maturity of community-run Solace DAO to take over this responsibility.
- Seed Round Investors: 5% (currently allocated 3.83%*).
- Advisors: 2% (currently allocated 0.4%*).

*unallocated tokens will remain in the Solace Launch DAO treasury and will be used at the discretion of the DAO in the future.

### Community: 68%

- Solace DAO Treasury: 50%. These funds will be governed directly by the community to finance contributor compensations, grants, operations, and other needs to sustain development of Solace long-term.
- Underwriting Pool: 10%.
- Incentives: 8%. This allocation encompasses all short to mid-term incentives we have put in place and are introducing along with the token launch, like bonding and staking. More information and exact details are coming in the next post.
