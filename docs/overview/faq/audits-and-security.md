# Audits and Security
---
### What audits has Solace undergone?
Solace has been audited by both [<u>Hacken</u>](https://hacken.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Solace_11102021SCAudit_Report.pdf) and [<u>Quantstamp</u>](https://solace.fi/static/media/Solace-Quantstamp-Report.44617837.pdf).

### What if there’s a bug in Solace’s smart contracts?
While there is no absolute guarantee that all of Solace’s smart contracts will be impenetrable to attacks, the team’s number #1 goal is safety, and our development exercises that in our code.

Check out Solace's DeFiSafety Review [here](https://www.defisafety.com/pqrs/378?develop=true).

That being said, there’s a rare chance that both your funds’ smart contract and Solace’s smart contracts fail simultaneously. By buying a wallet coverage policy, you’ve increased your protection by multiplying the probabilities of the occurrences.

For example, if there’s a 1% chance of a smart contract bug in any protocol, and you have a DeFi position and Solace cover on that position, then you have a 1% * 1% chance of a hack (0.01%). In other words, you’ve taken a 1 in 100 chance and decreased it to a 1 in 10,000 chance.
