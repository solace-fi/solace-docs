# Tokenomics
The $SOLACE token gives owners the rights to stake, which unlocks rights to voting and rights to a portion of $SOLACE emissions.

---

## What is the utility of the $SOLACE token?
The $SOLACE token gives holders the capability to stake the token to get governance rights and rewards from policy sales and token emissions. They can increase their reward size by taking advantage of staking locks to multiply their voting power and rewards.

## How do staking multipliers work?
When a user locks their $SOLACE in a staking safe, two multipliers are in play. One increases the token holder's governance voting power, and the other multiplier increases their staking rewards.

If $SOLACE is staked (made to $xSOLACE) and locked, the $xSOLACE multiplies up to 4x at the max lock duration of four years and linearly decreases based on lock duration. This rewards long-term locked stakers with more voting power:

- 1 $SOLACE staked and unlocked = 1 $xSOLACE
- 1 $SOLACE staked and locked for four years = 4 $xSOLACE (3 more votes than unlocked)

Similarly, locking $SOLACE will award a staking rewards multiplier up to 2.5x at the max lock duration of four years and linearly decreases based on lock duration.

- 1 $SOLACE staked and unlocked = 1x multiplier on rewards
- 1 $SOLACE staked and locked for four years = 2.5x multiplier on rewards (get 2.5x more $SOLACE than unlocked)

## How are staking rewards distributed?
The Staking APR will be based on token distribution from the DAO treasury. $SOLACE tokens will be distributed by the second, with 10 million $SOLACE given the first year of each chain the Solace launches on.

## Can I create multiple safes?
If a user would like to lock $SOLACE to multiply their voting power and rewards but donâ€™t want to lock all of their tokens in one lock time, they have the ability to create multiple safes, each with different lock times and subsequent multipliers.
