# Tokenomics
The $SOLACE token gives owners the rights to stake, which unlocks rights to voting and rights to a portion of $SOLACE emissions.

## How do you stake on Solace?
To stake on Solace, you must create a safe - locks that stake your $SOLACE for a set period of time. Locking introduces multipliers to both your voting power and staking rewards. When creating a safe, you must choose:

- the amount of $SOLACE you’d like to deposit from your wallet, and
- the length of the lock time.

If you select a deposit amount with lock time, you will receive the a multiplier on the regular APY based on the length.

## How do staking multipliers work?
Like we mentioned in our previous announcement article, there will be two multipliers in play. One will be specific to governance voting power, and the other will be specific to staking rewards.

If $SOLACE is staked (made to $xSOLACE) and locked, the $xSOLACE multiplies up to 4x at the max lock duration of four years and linearly decreases based on lock duration. This rewards long-term locked stakers with more voting power:

- 1 $SOLACE staked and unlocked = 1 $xSOLACE
- 1 $SOLACE staked and locked for four years = 4 $xSOLACE (3 more votes than unlocked)

Similarly, locking $SOLACE will award a staking rewards multiplier up to 2.5x at the max lock duration of four years and linearly decreases based on lock duration.

- 1 $SOLACE staked and unlocked = 1x multiplier on rewards
- 1 $SOLACE staked and locked for four years = 2.5x multiplier on rewards (get 2.5x more $SOLACE than unlocked)

## How are staking rewards distributed?
The new Staking APY will be based on token distribution from the DAO treasury. $SOLACE tokens will be distributed by the second, with 10 million $SOLACE given each year. We chose this number because we want to give enough $SOLACE to create a strong starting APY, but we also don’t want to distribute too much $SOLACE from the treasury so that token distribution can’t be done long-term. Nevertheless, the distribution of tokens is adjustable by governance.

## Can I create multiple safes?
If you’d like lock $SOLACE to take advantage of the multipliers but don’t want to lock all of your tokens for one lock time, you have the ability to create multiple safes, each with different multipliers and lock times.
