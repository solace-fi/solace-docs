# The Underwriting Pool

Solace acquires its own underwriting capital using the Protocol Liquidity Model to increase capital loyalty and to take the underwriting risk away from individual users.

Users can purchase $SOLACE bonds in exchange for a variety of assets, and Solace sends received assets to the underwriting pool that backs risks across all products. $SOLACE will also be used as an underwriting asset and for paying out claims. Solace Protocol owns this pool, and in a loss event, payouts will be made from this pool.

### How it works:
- All funds accumulate in a multi-collateral Underwriting Pool owned by Solace. This pool fulfills any potential claims and covers financial losses. Users are able to choose what asset to get as a payout.
- The revenue from the underwriting activity flows mostly to staked $SOLACE (a small fee will go to risk strategists, risk managers, and the DAO treasury in the future as we scale up the architecture).

These mechanisms open up some attractive opportunities and features for DeFi space:
- Users and funds can participate in underwriting activity with no risks of financial loss in case of insured events, and still earning yield from premiums and bonds sales and $SOLACE distribution.
- Anyone who wants to contribute to DeFi insurance can withdraw funds at any time with no influence on coverage capacity.
- Solace Protocol doesnâ€™t lose attraction in the eyes of capital providers after insured events.
- Owning the exact amount of the underwriting capital it needs to meet the demand helps to achieve higher capital efficiency.
- Available variety of assets for bonding open up the underwriting market for many users.
- Users can choose what token they want to receive as payout.
- To contribute to DeFi safety, you just need to buy/bond $SOLACE and stake it. Easy for everyone, helpful for everybody.

## How will cross-chain interoperability work with one underwriting pool?
As long as there is a consistent architecture between deployments on different EVM compatible chains, Solace can back risk on one chain using capital from another. The liquidity is only necessary on the chain that needs to pay out claims. Therefore, one main pool can exist, while other chains are funded to pay out claims via that pool.
