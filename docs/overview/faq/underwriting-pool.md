# The Underwriting Pool
---
Solace acquires its own underwriting capital using the Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL) Model to increase capital loyalty and to take the underwriting risk away from token holders.

Users can purchase $SOLACE bonds in exchange for a variety of assets, and Solace sends received assets to the underwriting pool that backs risks across all products. $SOLACE will also be used as an underwriting asset and for paying out claims. Solace Protocol owns this pool, and in a loss event, payouts will be made from this pool.

### How it works:
- All funds accumulate in a multi-collateral Underwriting Pool owned by Solace. This pool fulfills any potential claims and covers financial losses. Users will receive payouts in either ETH or stablecoins, depending on what is more liquid in the pool at that time.
- The revenue from the underwriting activity flows mostly to staked $SOLACE (a small fee will go to risk strategists, risk managers, and the DAO treasury in the future as we scale up the architecture).

These mechanisms open up some attractive opportunities and features for the DeFi space:
- Users and funds can participate in underwriting activity with no risks of financial loss in case of insured events, and earn yield from policy sales and token emissions.
- Anyone who wants to bond and stake $SOLACE can withdraw their tokens at any time with no influence on coverage capacity.
- There exist a variety of assets capable to use in different yield strategies.
- Users can choose what token they want to receive as payout.
- Crypto users can contribute to Solace's long-term goal of securing DeFi's safety through bonding $SOLACE and can get rewarded by staking the token.

## How will cross-chain interoperability work with one underwriting pool?
Solace partnered with the [Celer Network to implement their Celer Inter-Messaging system](). The Celer IM allows Solace to aggregate data across the multiple underwriting pools. Moreover, as long as there is a consistent architecture between deployments on different EVM compatible chains, Solace can back risk on one chain using capital from another. The liquidity is only necessary on the chain that needs to pay out claims. Therefore, one main pool can exist, while other chains are funded to pay out claims via that pool.
