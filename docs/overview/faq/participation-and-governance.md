# Participation and Governance

### How do I unlock voting power with my $SOLACE?
If you stake your $SOLACE, each token is worth one vote. You can increase your voting power up to 4x by locking your $SOLACE tokens. 

Voting occurs via the [Solace Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/solacefi.eth).

### Can I get involved and participate in $SOLACE?
Absolutely. The team is always looking for excited and committed community members to contribute to the protocol. Reach out to the team on Discord to learn more about available opportunities.

### How decentralized is $SOLACE?
At the moment we have launched Solace LaunchDAO, which acts as a coordination vehicle to deliver us to Solace DAO. This LaunchDAO holds the funds, $SOLACE tokens, is controlled by the Launch DAO tokens and primarily votes on high-level protocol decisions of significant importance. The funds are released in a drip fashion over time to finance the development and growth and ultimately ensure transition into a formal community-run DAO structure.

The purpose of this Launch DAO is to bootstrap the development and allow for rapid scaling of Solaceâ€™s platform. Eventually, Solace will reach the point where the governance can be handed off to the community and Solace can be a self-sustaining protocol. With that in mind, our job is to push the project forward, build a community around it, and create a system that will inherit the rule.
