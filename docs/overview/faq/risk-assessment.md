# Risk Assessment

### Does Solace use $SOLACE tokens to vote on claims approvals?
No. $SOLACE is a governance token, but it is not used to vote on approving claims. Instead, Solace uses our PACLAS system and other claims assessment models to determine if a claim can be submitted.

### How does Solace assess risk for protocols?
Solace utilizes the Risk Rating Engine to assess protocols through multiple variables, including but not limited to total value locked (TVL), age of protocol, number of audits, and use of oracles.

There are currently four risk levels we categorize protocols on.

| Risk Level | Percentage Fee | Tier Rank | Description |
|------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | 2% | S | Safe |
| 2 | 2.5% | A | Mostly Safe |
| - | - | B | - |
| 3 | 8% | C | Risky |
| - | - | D | - |
| - | - | E | - |
| 0 | 20% | F | Unknown |

As the ensemble of risk engines increases as Solace's adoption increases, we hope to create more granular levels to follow the S-F tier system.
