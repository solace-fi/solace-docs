# Risk Assessment
---
### Does Solace use $SOLACE tokens to vote on claims approvals?
No. $SOLACE is a governance token, but it is not used to vote on approving claims. Instead, Solace controls its own underwriting liquidity and the risk management team determines what loss events are qualifiable to pay out.

### How does Solace assess risk for protocols?
Learn more about the details of the risk assessment infrastructure [<u>here</u>](../../architecture/risk-assessment-infra).
