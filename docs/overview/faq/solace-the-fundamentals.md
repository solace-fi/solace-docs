# Solace: The Fundamentals

---

## Why was Solace Built?
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is one of the fastest growing industries in the world, and will continue to grow over the next 15 years. However, like any rapidly growing industry, growing pains ensue. For DeFi, one major pain is the hacks and exploits that take advantage of non-battle tested smart contracts.

In the last year alone, 76% of major hacks occurred in DeFi protocols, totalling at ~$361 million of theft. As DeFi continues to grow in the next decade, it is likely that hacks and exploits will increase, especially as new, crypto-specific financial products and services emerge.

There is major demand for DeFi insurance among crypto users. The problem why DeFi insurance hasn't grown alongside DeFi is because competitors have not designed their offerings for scalability, simplicity, and transparency. And because current DeFi insurance hasn't grown properly, DeFi remains a risky space. If this high risk continues to exist, it will hinder expected growth of DeFi.

Solace focuses on building innovative tools that match the ever-changing needs of crypto users. That's why with Solace Wallet Coverage, users get personalized coverage and only pay for what coverage they use. We understand that the DeFi space moves quickly, and we want policyholders to feel confident about their security as they explore DeFi positions.

Born as a DAO, Solace’s mission is to create innovative and intuitive DeFi insurance products for crypto users.

## What is Solace?
Solace is a decentralized insurance protocol ran by the Solace DAO. The Solace DAO focuses on building innovative and intuitive coverage products to protect users as they explore DeFi protocols and ecosystems. Solace's flagship product is Solace Wallet Coverage, where users can fund a single policy and only pay based on what’s in your wallet.

Solace focuses on three key differentiators:

#### **Designing for Simplicity**
Other protocols put the risk assessment process on the user, forcing them to either buy coverage for every position they have, or carefully select the positions that need coverage. It’s not a model that thinks about the user first.

Solace Wallet Coverage works like buying a pre-paid phone card. Load in a balance, and it gets charged as you hold a wallet policy. To get a policy, users take three easy steps: connect their wallet to Solace, set a coverage limit, and load a balance.

Users don’t ever have to file a claim to get their funds back, and they receive a payout during qualifiable loss events within one week.

#### **Built to Scale**
Solace utilizes a bonds program to where users can exchange token assets for the $SOLACE token, which can be used in staking to earn rewards from policy sales and token emissions. Unlike the competitors that have staker's liquidity leveraged against for policy sales, Solace takes the assets from the bond program and set them in the [<u>Underwriting Pool</u>](/docs/architecture/underwriting-pool) to sell policies against.

#### **Transparency Now and for the Future**
Solace is the only crypto protection protocol to publish it’s pricing, risk data and risk models to GitHub and decentralized storage using IPFS.

## What is the governance structure?
Please check our [<u>Admin pages</u>](/docs/admin/overview) to learn about the DAO-first structure. You can also read [<u>our DAO blog post</u>](https://link.medium.com/cQ8cWwY16jb) that outlines the governance structure.

### DAO-first capital formation
Pioneered by BarnBridge and Kain Warwick’s ideas, this crypto native approach offers a unique ability to run the project as a DAO from day 0, have complete transparency, equitable voting, and quickly adjust to an ever-changing environment in DeFi. This setup entails that the project is financed and launched by a decentralized governance model.

### DAO structure
[<u>Solace LaunchDAO</u>](/docs/admin/launch-dao) acts as a coordination vehicle to deliver the Solace DAO. This LaunchDAO holds the funds, $SOLACE tokens, is controlled by LaunchDAO tokens, held by the core team, advisors, and investors. The group primarily votes on high-level protocol decisions of significant importance. The funds are released in a drip fashion over time to finance the development and growth and ultimately ensure transition into a formal community-run DAO structure.

### Transition to Community-run DAO in the Future
The purpose of this Launch DAO is to bootstrap the development and allow for rapid scaling of Solace’s platform. Eventually we are going to reach the point where the governance can be handed off to the community and Solace can be a self-sustaining protocol. With that in mind, our job is to push the project forward, build a community around it, and create a system that will inherit the rule.

Starting October, we plan to allocate resources to the development of Solace DAO, so you can expect the transition to happen around the end of this year.
