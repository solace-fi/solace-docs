# Solace: The Fundamentals

## Why was Solace Built?
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a revolution in finance, and it is one of the fastest growing industries in the world. Currently, [$100 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1237821/defi-market-size-value-crypto-locked-usd/) is locked in DeFi projects and proposals, and [some investors believe the market cap could break $80 trillion](https://cointelegraph.com/news/tim-draper-predicts-total-crypto-market-cap-of-80-trillion-in-next-15-years#:~:text=Sep%2015%2C%202018-,Tim%20Draper%20Predicts%20Total%20Crypto%20Market%20Cap%20of%20%2480%20Trillion,in%20the%20next%2015%20years.) in the next 15 years. However, like any rapidly growing industry, growing pains ensue, and DeFi is not an exception to this rule.

In the last year alone, 76% of major hacks occurred in DeFi protocols, totalling at ~$361 million of theft. As DeFi continues to grow in the next decade, it is likely that hacks and exploits will increase, especially as new financial product concepts emerge.

Currently, there are no coverage options that implement a structure that is efficient, secure and intelligent offering for millions of retail users and institutional players. DeFi remains a risky space, which hinders the growth and prevents crypto applications in becoming a real alternative for TradFi.

Moreover, the existing solutions in decentralized insurance are too complex and inefficient. Other protocols put the risk assessment process on the user, forcing them to either buy coverage for every position they have, or carefully select the positions that need coverage. It’s not a model that thinks about the user first. 

Born as a DAO, Solace’s mission is to forge innovation into intuitive protection tools for crypto explorers across DeFi platforms. With its wallet coverage, Solace is the only crypto protection protocol that offers simple, intelligent and transparent protection 
tools for people who want to explore crypto without compromising safety.

## What is Solace?
Solace is a decentralized insurance protocol ran by the Solace DAO, and the DAO focuses on building innovative and intuitive coverage products to protect users as they explore DeFi and the greater crypto ecosystem. Solace's flagship product is the wallet coverage, where users can fund a single policy and only pay based on what’s in your wallet.

Solace focuses on three key differentiators: 

### Designing for Simplicity
Solace breaks the pattern of over-complexity in crypto insurance. Other protocols put the risk assessment process on the user, forcing them to either buy coverage for every position they have, or carefully select the positions that need coverage. It’s not a model that thinks about the user first. 

Solace makes protecting crypto investments as simple as buying a prepaid debit card. Policy buyers connect their wallet to solace.fi and get an estimate on a single policy for their entire portfolio based on risk ratings of each position.

Moreover, Solace keeps pricing flexible. Once Solace quotes for a yearly price of coverage, the user determines how much premium they’d like to load onto their policy. Once a balance is added, Solace starts covering the wallet automatically. As investment positions are entered and exited, the policy premium charges only for the cover used.

### Intelligence in Every Step of the Process
Solace doesn’t rely on human voting or market bias to approve claims. Instead, Solace designed a parametric claims process to make the experience hassle-free. Users don’t ever have to file a claim to get their funds back. Thanks to our parametric claims assessment system (PACLAS), users receive a payout during qualifiable loss events within one week. 

Solace did not want to follow the competition and get underwriting liquidity from mercenary capital or by requiring users stake their tokens and pay for loss events. Instead, Solace utilizes a bonds program to exchange $SOLACE for token assets that are locked in the underwriting pool. We allow users to stake $SOLACE without the concern of losing their funds.

### Transparency Now and for the Future
Solace is the only crypto protection protocol to publish it’s pricing, risk data and risk models to GitHub and decentralized storage using IPFS. Risk managers are invited to participate in the governance process by joining the DAO, contributing to risk surveys, or by creating their own risk products. 

Solace is building a community around making this space safe, secure and trusted so that we can onboard and de-risk DeFi and other crypto applications while opening the space to millions of users. We recently launched a coverage policy protocol that enables protection for liquidity providers, Defi protocols or DAOs to mitigate loss from hacks, bugs and exploits. Our purpose is to transform DeFi by delivering intelligent and empowering tools for a safe, secure and trusted industry. 

## What is the governance structure?
Please read [our DAO blog post](https://link.medium.com/cQ8cWwY16jb) that outlines the current governance structure in more detail.

### DAO-first capital formation
Pioneered by BarnBridge and Kain Warwick’s ideas, this crypto native approach offers a unique ability to run the project as a DAO from day 0, have complete transparency, equitable voting, and quickly adjust to an ever-changing environment in DeFi. This setup entails that the project is financed and launched by a decentralized governance model.

### DAO structure
At the moment we have launched Solace LaunchDAO, which acts as a coordination vehicle to deliver us to Solace DAO. This LaunchDAO holds the funds, $SOLACE tokens, is controlled by the Launch DAO tokens and primarily votes on high-level protocol decisions of significant importance. The funds are released in a drip fashion over time to finance the development and growth and ultimately ensure transition into a formal community-run DAO structure.

### Transition to Community-run DAO in the Future
The purpose of this Launch DAO is to bootstrap the development and allow for rapid scaling of Solace’s platform. Eventually we are going to reach the point where the governance can be handed off to the community and Solace can be a self-sustaining protocol. With that in mind, our job is to push the project forward, build a community around it, and create a system that will inherit the rule.

Starting October, we plan to allocate resources to the development of Solace DAO, so you can expect the transition to happen around the end of this year.
