# No Claim Filing

---

### How does Solace pay for loss events without a claims process?
Solace's risk management team does an on-chain assessment when a loss events is detected in a policyholder's wallets. As long as a policyholder has active coverage on their wallet that experienced a loss event, Solace will pay out claims within one week.

### When is loss of funds determined for a claim?
Solace currently uses on-chain invariance evidence as a mean to determine whether or not a qualifiable loss event occured. The risk management team publishes a loss event report and publish it for the Solace DAO to review. From there, payouts are processed. In the future, Solace will utilize a parametric auto claims assessment system (PACLAS), which actively monitors coverage policies, determines financial losses, and signs proof that allows users to receive a pay out within one week.
