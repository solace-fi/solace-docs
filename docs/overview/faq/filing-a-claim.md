# No Claim Filing

---

### How does Solace pay for loss events without a claims process?
Solace detects loss events in policyholder's wallets. As long as a policyholder has active coverage on their wallet that experienced a loss event, Solace will pay out claims within one week.

### When is loss of funds determined for a claim?
Solace will utilize a parametric auto claims assessment system (PACLAS), which monitors coverage policies, determines financial losses, and signs proof that allows users to receive a pay out within one week.
