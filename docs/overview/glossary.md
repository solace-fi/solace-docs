# Glossary

**APR (Annual Percentage Rate):** The APR is the annual rate a borrower must pay each year, It represents the yearly cost of a loan. The APR is calculated with a simple interest rate and does not take into account compounding. 

**APY (Annual Percentage Yield):** The APY is the annual rate of return of a deposit, taking into account compounding interest. (Example: a $1000 deposit compounded annually with a 6% APY  would return $1000 * (1.06) the first year and ($1000 * (1.06)) * 1.06 the second year, etc.) 

**Solace Bonds:** Mechanism in Olympus Pro style, that allows users to buy $SOLACE with discount through bonding variety of assets so Protocol could own its underwriting capital and liquidity.

**DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization):** Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are a new formation structure that allows a community to govern versus a typical management structure. Participants can own, coordinate and govern in a decentralized manner to achieve a common purpose. DAO is usually run by a core team reporting directly to a community, with the goal to progressively decentralize power across its community in a manner designed to encourage engagement, participation, and financial alignment with the DAOs long-term success. Learn more about Solace DAO.

**DEX (Decentralized Exchange):** Decentralized exchanges are platforms that enable users to trade crypto peer-to-peer on the blockchain without any intermediaries. 

**Escrow:** An escrow is a third party that holds assets in trust and will turn those assets over to the “rightful owner” once some conditions have been met.

**Flash loan attack (Covered by Solace):**  An attack to manipulate the market via flash loans. A user typically borrows funds that do not require collateral, this user then manipulates the price of a crypto on an exchange by dumping or buying a large amount of token on it. Following this action, the user can either acquire new tokens very cheaply or sell ones at a higher price in the manipulated smart contract.

**Hedge a risk:** Hedging is a strategy employed to reduce exposure to risks and compensate for losses in investments by taking an opposite position in a related asset. When one asset value goes down, the other one should be going up.

**Impermanent Loss:** Impermanent loss is a risk of a fund losing value when holding tokens is more profitable than earning fees from a liquidity pool. This is usually explained by an uneven ratio of tokens in the liquidity pool due to the price change.

**Liquidity pool:** Liquidity pools are pools of different tokens and cryptocurrencies crowded together and locked into smart contracts. Liquidity pools are mainly used to trade different tokens on DEXes automatically, without the use of a matching engine that finds buyers and sellers willing to trade. In other words, thanks to smart contracts, liquidity pools enable peer-to-peer trading.

**Liquidity provider:** A liquidity provider provides funds to the liquidity pool. They earn a portion of the fees from transactions using the pool.

**Minting vulnerability (Covered by Solace):** Minting vulnerabilities are bug/vulnerabilities in a smart contract that enables an entity to mint(create) a large number of tokens. This usually results in the price of the token minted crashing down. 

**Price Arbitrage:** A process where a user buys an asset on an exchange and sells it on another at a higher price for gains at the same time.

**Solace Protocol:** The program behind Solace that aims to allow anybody to underwrite, create and buy cover permissionlessly.

**Proxy Manipulation (Covered by Solace):** Exploits linked to proxy contracts. Some vectors of exploit include a proxy impersonating another proxy and faulty proxy contracts.

**Proxy Contracts:** A proxy contract calls to new contracts as a way to upgrade an existing smart contract. In other words, a mechanism that helps integrate updates to smart contracts.

**Re-entry attack (Covered by Solace):** A smart contract exploit where the balance of an account is not immediately updated when a user withdraws funds. This enables an entity to withdraw more funds than it should.

**Solace Claim Assessments:** A parametric auto claims assessment system (aka PACLAS) monitors coverage policies, determines financial losses, and signs proof that allows users to submit a claim transaction and receive a payout.

**Solace Coverage Policies:** NFT (ERC-721) tokens that represent underwriters’ obligation to pay out financial losses carried by the policyholders in the event of a technical failure or exploit.

**Solace Coverage Products:** A suite of smart contracts managed by risk assessment models that allow users to purchase coverage.

**Solace Risk Assessment:** A combination of risk assessment models distribute coverage capacity (granted by the underwriting pool) across their respective products.

**Staking:** Mechanism for users to get revenue from Protocol’s activities, token distribution, and to unlock the governance rights.

**Capital Stickiness:** It means that capital doesn’t change/doesn’t move regularly, like capitals of underwriting pools.

**Trojan fake token (Covered by Solace):** When an entity makes a smart contract "think" one token is another one.
Solace Underwriting Pool: Multi-collateral capital pool, owned by Protocol, underwrites the risk across multiple risk assessment models. This pool is leveraged to back the risk of sold coverage policies and compensate losses for policyholders (within coverage limit).

**Vesting:** Vesting is the process to give an entity the right to claim an asset after a period of time or some milestones are reached.
