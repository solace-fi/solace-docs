title: How Solace assesses protocolâ€™s risk score for particular protocol

---

We use different data sources in order to collect a wide range of risk-related attributes about DeFi protocols. We currently collect the following information about each protocol:
1. Total Value Locked (TVL)
2. Blockchain Platform
3. Number of Users
4. Transaction Activity 5 Time Since Launch
5. sNumber of Audits

We use the following sources to retrieve this information:
- DeFi Llama
- Defiyield
- Rekt news
- CryptoSec

Solace uses historical data for these parameters as well as expert judgement (determined by governance vote) to calculate the risk rate for each DeFi protocol.

**NOTE**: For now our team gather information only for protocols presented on Zapper.
