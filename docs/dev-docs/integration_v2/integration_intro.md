## Introduction

Our team is constantly working on the quality of DeFi protocols risk assessments by investigating DeFi space and results of public protocols audits. Also we closely work with top experts in smart contract security to continuously validate our risk data pipeline and risk assessment engine. You can get access to all resulted data literally in a few lines of code in your dApp and share this information with your users.

We believe that honestly providing users with information about the risks in the DeFi space will greatly reduce losses of newcomers, increase confidence in the industry as a whole, and accelerate widespread adoption of DeFi. 

For now available following integrations:

1) Solace Portfolio Simulator integration (Link to Portfolio Simulator integration

You can add functionality to your dApp that allows the user to get a risk assessment of the collected portfolio. In short, the user selects the protocols and the amount of USD he is going to lock into them. The portfolio simulator shows the risk score for each project separately, and returns an overall portfolio risk rate, taking into account the position weights and the cross-correlation of the risks of protocols of different types. 

2) Solace Portofolio Insurance integration (Link to SPI integration)

You can add functionality to your dApp that allows to get data about DeFi positions of the user in all networks, to estimate the insurance price rate and give users the opportunity to buy a insurance policy directly from the interface.
