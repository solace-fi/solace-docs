In this section, we'll show you what steps you need to take to implement a **Portfolio simulator** on your dApp using **Solace API**. The Solace portfolio simulator provides users the ability to get a **risk rate** for a composed portfolio and get an estimated **portfolio price rate**.

Using a **Portfolio simulator** allows the users to get information about the riskiness of each DeFi position in the portfolio and estimate diversification of the simulated portfolio, get the **risk rate** for the entire portfolio, and day/month/year premium for it. The portfolio simulator makes it possible to compare the potential loss in the event of a hack with the cost of insurance and decide whether to insure their digital assets or not.
