**DeFi position** - crypto-assets that have been locked into a smart contract in order to earn rewards in tokens. 

**Portfolio** - a range of  investments to DeFi protocols held by a person or organization.

**Portfolio simulator** - functionality that allows the user to get information about the riskiness of the collected portfolio and calculate the price rate for it.

**Protocol risk score** - a floating point number that numerically characterizes the riskiness of the particular project.

**Risk tier** - Solace risk assessment engine classifies protocols into 4 risk tiers depends on their risk score:
0 -  not enough data about project (i.e. most risky)
1- low risk
2 - medium risk
3 - high risk

**Portfolio risk rate** - a number that numerically characterizes the riskiness of the portfolio. The higher the risk rate, the riskier the portfolio and the more you have to pay per day for insurance.

**Solace Insurance** -  a suite of smart contracts managed by risk assessment models that allow users to purchase coverage for their DeFi positions.

**Protocol category** -  at the moment we use classification provided by Zapper. According Zapper each protocol is categorized into one of the following:
- yield-aggregator
- lending
- liquidity-pool
- exchange
- asset-management
- unknown
- other

**Solace API** - programming interface that allows to get access to risk data and risk assessment engine.

**Risk assessment engine** -  a set of algorithms that allows you to get an estimate of the riskiness of a portfolio based on a database of the riskiness of individual protocols and the relationship of different protocols to each other. 

**Insurance policy** - NFT (ERC-721) tokens that represent underwritersâ€™ obligation to pay out financial losses carried by the policyholders in the event of a technical failure or exploit.

**Portfolio price rate** - the price of the insurance, which is charged to the user on a regular basis. The higher the portfolio risk rate, the higher the portfolio price rate.

**appID** - the unique text identifier of a decentralized application supported by Solace. We use appIDs, which are defined by Zapper for each protocol.
