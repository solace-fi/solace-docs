# Buy Solace Portfolio Insurance
---
You will need DAI to purchase wallet cover. Once you have DAI, follow these steps:

1. First, open the Solace DApp and connect your wallet that has the tokens you want to insure.
2. Click on user icon on the right hand side and select “My Policy” tab.
3. Solace will fetch your portfolio balances.
4. Confirm the coverage limit based on your wallet positions. Solace automatically selects a recommended value of 120% of your highest position, but you can manually adjust based on your needs.
5. Select the token you would like to deposit a balance of for Solace to use and pay weekly premiums with. Currently, users can pay in $SOLACE, $USDC, $USDT, $DAI, and $FRAX. 
6. Confirm the transaction deposit and activate the policy.
