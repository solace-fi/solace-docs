You will need DAI to purchase wallet cover. Once you have DAI, follow these steps:

3. Click on the “Buy Cover” tab and click Continue.
4. Choose the coverage limit based on your wallet positions. Your rate for coverage will be based on your coverage limit. There are three options for coverage:
    1. Highest position value
    2. Highest position value + 20%
    3. Manual input value
5. Go to the Policy Balance section and deposit a balance of DAI. Confirm the transaction deposit the DAI and create the policy.
