3. Click "Copy Code" to get your referral code, or "Copy Link" to get a referral link

## Referral code conditions

A valid referral code meets the following criteria:
1. The referral code is a valid 65-byte (or 130-hex character) Ethereum ECDSA signature
2. The referee (party applying the referral code) is not the referrer. I.e. you cannot refer to yourself
3. The referrer must have an active portfolio insurance policy
4. The referee has not previously used a referral code. I.e. you can only apply a referral code once for each account

Once you have entered a valid referral code, you will get 50 USD of bonus points. These bonus points will be spent before the funds you have personally deposited into the protocol.

To deter gaming the referral code mechanism, **bonus points will only be spendable AFTER the account has spent 100 USD in premiums**.
