2. A Metamask window will pop-up asking you to sign a message. Click "Sign".

*Under the hood the referral code is an [Ethereum ECDSA signature](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712)*

3. Click "Copy Code" to get your referral code, or "Copy Link" to get a referral link

## Referral code conditions

A valid referral code meets the following criteria:
1. The referral code is a valid 65-byte (or 130-hex character) Ethereum ECDSA signature
2. The referee (party applying the referral code) is not the referrer. I.e. you cannot refer to yourself
3. The referrer must have an active wallet coverage policy
4. The referee has not previously used a referral code. I.e. you can only apply a referral code once for each account

Once you have entered a valid referral code, you will get 50 USD of bonus points. These bonus points will be spent before the funds you have personally deposited into the protocol.

To deter gaming the referral code mechanism, **bonus points will only be spendable AFTER the account has spent 100 USD in premiums**.

## FAQ

**1. When I use a referral link, do I get a free deposit right away or do I need to first deposit some funds?**

You have to first deposit some funds.

To use a referral link you have to create a policy, and you cannot create a policy with 0 deposit. Also note you get the referral bonus when you enter a valid referral code or link, but the bonus is not usable until you have spent 100 USD or more in premiums (subject to governance decision).
