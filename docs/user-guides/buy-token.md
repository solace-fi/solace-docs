# Buy $SOLACE Token

The first way and best way to invest into Solace's future is to purchase $SOLACE via bonds. Bonds allow you to use several different tokens to purchase $SOLACE at a discount. The vesting period for tokens purchased via bonds is five days. The steps are:
- Go to [<u>Solace's Website</u>](https://solace.fi/bond), and connect your wallet.
- Decide the token you would like to purchase a bond with and click Bond.
- Input your desired amount of tokens you would like to provide.
- (Optional) If you would like to have your bonded tokens staked, select “Auto-stake and receive xSOLACE”
- Confirm the transaction in your wallet.
