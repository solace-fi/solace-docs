There are three pools and two farms anyone can become a liquidity provider (LP) for $SOLACE:

1. Ethereum: [<u>$SOLACE on Sushiswap</u>](https://app.sushi.com/swap?inputCurrency=0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48&outputCurrency=0x501acE9c35E60f03A2af4d484f49F9B1EFde9f40 ) in a $SOLACE/USDC pool
2. Aurora: [<u>$SOLACE on Trisolaris</u>](https://www.trisolaris.io/#/swap?inputCurrency=0xC42C30aC6Cc15faC9bD938618BcaA1a1FaE8501d&outputCurrency=0x501acE9c35E60f03A2af4d484f49F9B1EFde9f40) in a $SOLACE/wNEAR pool

## How to LP and Farm on Polygon
---

First and foremost, you need to get funds to Polygon using the Polygon [<u>bridge</u>](https://wallet.polygon.technology/bridge). You can bridge any major token through the bridge, including $SOLACE by pasting this address in the custom token search: 0x501acE9c35E60f03A2af4d484f49F9B1EFde9f40

Once you have tokens on Polygon:

1. Get some $SOLACE from [<u>bonds</u>](https://solace.fi/bond) or from the [<u>SOLACE/FRAX</u>](https://www.sorbet.finance/#/pools/0x38e7e05Dfd9fa3dE80dB0e7AC03AC57Fa832C78A) pool, and get some FRAX either from the same pool or any other FRAX pool.
2. Go to Sorbet Finance, and input the [<u>SOLACE/FRAX</u>](https://www.sorbet.finance/#/pools/0x38e7e05Dfd9fa3dE80dB0e7AC03AC57Fa832C78A) pool.
3. Input SOLACE and FRAX tokens for a pair, and add liquidity to the pair.
4. Go to GYSR, and find the [<u>SOLACE/FRAX</u>](https://app.gysr.io/pool/0xf54f26ec9657664c098d4a6879d52cc8bdeccc50) pool.
5. Select the pool and stake your G-UNI tokens to begin earning from the $SOLACE farm.
