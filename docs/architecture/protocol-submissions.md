# Submission Requests
---

In order to submit data or expert judgment to the pipeline, users can fill out a protocol submission form with the information required to evaluate the request. If accepted, we will add the data/judgment to the pipeline and the submitter will receive a reward in the form of $SOLACE.

The form is currently a WIP. We will update the community and documentation once the process is complete.

## Submitting projects to the pipeline
Project owners can include their projects in Solace Portfolio Insurance by applying for support from Zapper [<u>here</u>](https://zapper.canny.io/protocol-requests).

Governance will review the submission, and if accepted, the project will be included in the next rating series publication.
