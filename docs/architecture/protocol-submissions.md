# Submission Requests

## Submitting data to the pipeline

In order to submit data or expert judgement to the pipeline, users can fill a protocol submission form and provide information necessary for governance to evaluate the request. If the request is accepted, the data or judgement will be added to the pipeline, and the submitter will receive a reward in the form of $SOLACE. 

The form is currently in WIP. We will update the community and documentation when the process is complete.

## Submitting projects to the pipeline

Project owners can include their projects in the wallet coverage by applying to be supported by Zapper [<u>here</u>](https://zapper.canny.io/protocol-requests).

Governance will review the submission and if accepted the project will be included next time a rating series is published.
