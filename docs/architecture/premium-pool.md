# Premium Pool
---
The premium pool is a multisig controlled by members of the Solace core team that accumulates users' crypto assets from buying Solace Portfolio Insurance. 

It is important to note that deposits into Solace Portfolio Insurance don’t directly go to the Premium pool. All users’ deposits into Solace Portfolio Insurance are held by the Portfolio Insurance contract until the Solace team charges premiums which sends them to the Premium pool.

After crypto assets are transferred to the Premium pool, they can be transferred to:

1. the Underwriting pool to increase the depth of this pool
2. the Core wallet
