# The Underwriting Pool
---
In order to pay out claims, SOLACE utilizes a pool from which it will take money from if a covered protocol is hacked. This pool is funded through Solace bonds from users who want to provide their assets in return for yield from staking.

During the beginning of the protocol, users provided their assets to the Solace's first uderwriting pool from September to November 2021 and received $SOLACE rewards over this period. Such an approach has two drawbacks:

1. For users: In this case, users share the risks. Since payments are made from the Underwriting pool, the volume of the pool can decrease. This leads to a loss of users' funds.
2. For Solace: If users are able to remove assets from the Underwriting pool whenever they want, it leads to dynamic changing of the underwriting pool size. Hence, it was impossible to guarantee the availability of the necessary amount of funds in the pool to pay all obligations.

Therefore, the Solace core team moved to the bonding mechanics to give users $SOLACE at a discount.

## Understanding Bond Mechanics
---
### What is the main motivation for a person to send his assets into the Underwriting pool? 

In normal market activities, bonds give $SOLACE to users at a discount.

### What conditions are desirable for Solace?
Users should keep their funds as long as possible in the protocol, and bonding allows Solace to ensure these requirements to a certain degree. 

### How does it work?
The user sends one of the allowed assets to the protocol through the Solace interface. In order to do so, the user needs to choose a crypto asset (it is DAI, ETH, USDC, SCP, WBTC, USDT) and confirm transactions that transfer crypto assets from the userâ€™s address to Solace Underwiring Pool. In return, the user will receive SOLACE tokens with a 20 % discount. 

<b>NOTE:</b> The protocol takes 5% of all bonds to the DAO multisig to contribute to paying contributers and the core teams.
