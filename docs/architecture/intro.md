Our risk management team is building scalable pipelines that can become increasingly decentralized as the community grows. For Solace Portfolio Insurance, the main task was to aggregate enough data to be able to come up with predictive variables for the likelihood of exploits. The long-term goal activate community members to contribute to the data aggregation process and come up with their own analysis and judgements, ultimately increasing the awareness and data availability in the whole DeFi space. Governance will play a key role here and all submissions will be reviewed by the governance members through voting.
